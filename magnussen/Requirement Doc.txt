I think mere archiving project ka closest match ye hoga
I have just started using this
Features are exactly what I need right now:


1. Fetch an article
2. Archive it
3. Annotate
ye teeno features mil gaye

jo nahi mila...
4. Offline use (app mein ho, sayad)
5. Keeping it for life (jab tak company ki saans chal rahi hai)
6. Access from a Bash Shell (so that I can use it on a sasta laptop)
7. Tag cloud from similar words (so that I can type tags when I don't remember the exact contents article)
8. Creating Tree (based on topic e.g. Video games n violence wale sare articles be clubbed under one node)..

..aur bhi req. hain mere.. 

but so far, this one's good.


One liner desc for the Archiving app I was talking about:

Quickly searchable, offline, and bash terminal access wala Hacker News chahiye mujhe (with article ka auto web archiving facility for future access) 


https://outline.com/ - ye kaafi requirements meet kar raha hai mere
