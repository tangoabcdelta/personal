# Install Nexus Locally

To install Nexus on a Mac, download the appropriate Nexus package from the Sonatype website, then unzip it into a desired directory on your system and start the Nexus service by running the provided startup script; most commonly, this involves downloading a DMG file, opening it, and dragging the Nexus application to your Applications folder to install it.

### Key steps:

### Important Considerations:
