# Who really invented the key ideas behind today's AI (like ChatGPT)?

- Jürgen Schmidhuber's post accuses Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun of republishing his 1990s AI innovations—like unsupervised pre-training and attention mechanisms—without citation, linking to a detailed critique listing over a dozen disputes from his early papers under resource constraints.
- The accompanying cartoon depicts the trio at a desk amid bookshelves labeled with pre-2010 AI milestones (e.g., "Gradient Descent 1847," "LSTM 1997"), satirizing their 2018 Turing Award narrative that overlooks prior art, including Schmidhuber's foundational works on deep learning hierarchies.
- Replies mix support for Schmidhuber's claims with defenses invoking Stigler's Law of Eponymy—where discoveries are named after later popularizers—highlighting ongoing debates in AI history, though peer-reviewed evidence like his 1991 Neural Computation paper on multi-layer networks substantiates his priorities.

Here's a super-simple way to explain it (perfect for telling friends or posting online): There's a big fight about who really invented the key ideas behind today's AI (like ChatGPT).

- Professor Jürgen Schmidhuber (from Switzerland) says: "I published these big ideas in the 1990s — things like 'attention' and training neural networks layer by layer without labels."
- In 2018, three other famous scientists (Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun) won the "Nobel Prize of computer science" (the Turing Award). Many news stories said they were the "godfathers of AI" and invented deep learning.
- Schmidhuber is upset because those three guys and the media almost never mention his earlier work. He feels they took his ideas, made them popular later, and got all the credit.
- He posted a cartoon showing the three winners sitting in a library full of old books (his books!) while acting like they discovered everything themselves.

**In short:**

Schmidhuber is saying: "I did it first in the 90s, with almost no money or help. They did it later with big teams and forgot to say thank you or even cite me."

It's like someone invented the skateboard in their garage in 1995, then in 2018 three cool kids with sponsors started selling skateboards, and everyone called those three kids the inventors. The garage guy is now shouting: "Hey, that was mine!"
